# Progress - 2026-02-11

## Tasks
- Analyzed `src/cnc_control/driver.py` and `architecture.md`.
- Documenting the driver's control and safety mechanisms.
- Identifying gaps between current driver implementation and proposed architecture.

## Findings
- `driver.py` uses `serial` logic with `G-Code` commands.
- Safety includes soft limits checks, alarm state handling, and a `safe_move` method.
- Current `Mill` class lacks `BaseInstrument` inheritance and standard `health_check` methods proposed in `architecture.md`.
