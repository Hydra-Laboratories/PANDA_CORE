## YOLOv8 Webcam Project

- Created a new project directory `webcam_yolo` for real-time object detection.
- Followed TDD: Wrote `tests/test_app.py` first, mocking `cv2` and `ultralytics`.
- Implemented `main.py` with `load_model`, `process_frame` (for inference and plotting), and `calculate_fps`.
- Resolved a test isolation issue by mocking globally in the test file.
- Created `requirements.txt` and `README.md`.

## Upgrade to YOLO11

- Updated `tests/test_app.py` to expect `yolo11n.pt`.
- Updated `main.py` to load `yolo11n.pt` and changed UI text to "YOLO11".
- Updated `README.md` to reflect the model change.
